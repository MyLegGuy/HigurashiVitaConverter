Please use this C# program to convert the game assets to work with Higurashi-Vita.
	You need the .NET framework for this.
		And Windows.

To use this, place the StreamingAssets folder from any Higurashi game in the same folder as the exe and run it.
After it says the conversion is done, place the StreamingAssets folder at ux0:data/HIGURASHI/StreamingAsstes.

I plan to have text and video tutorials for this process by the time I make a thread.
