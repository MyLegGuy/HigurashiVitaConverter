Please use this C# program to convert the game assets to work with Higurashi-Vita.
	You need the .NET framework for this. Most people already have it.
	If you're on macOS or Linux, you can use Mono.
		http://www.mono-project.com/

To use this, place the StreamingAssets folder from any Higurashi game in the same folder as the exe and run it.
After it says the conversion is done, place the StreamingAssets folder inside ux0:data/HIGURASHI/Games/ or...I think /3ds/data/HIGURASHI/Games/.
